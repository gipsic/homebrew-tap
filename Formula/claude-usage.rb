# Homebrew formula for claude-usage.
#
# Lives in the tap gipsic/homebrew-tap; this copy is the source of truth and is
# what bin/release-homebrew.sh copies over on release.
#
#   brew tap gipsic/tap
#   brew install claude-usage
#
# It installs from the GitHub release tarball rather than npm: the package has no
# dependencies, so there is nothing for npm to resolve, and the sh launcher in
# the tarball is the one that finds node under nvm/fnm/volta when launchd starts
# the agent with a bare PATH.

    <<~EOS
      Start the background tracker (a launchd agent that runs at login):
        claude-usage install-daemon

      Then open the dashboard:
        claude-usage serve --open      # http://127.0.0.1:4778

      Percentages come from your own Claude Code login. The first read may ask
      whether node may access "Claude Code-credentials" - choose Always Allow.
      Nothing leaves the machine except the usage request to api.anthropic.com.
